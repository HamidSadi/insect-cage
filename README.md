In this project, I conducted a time-series regression and classification analysis on an insect capturing dataset to identify patterns, forecast insect populations, and analyze key environmental factors influencing capture rates.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
âœ… Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
âœ… Applied time-series regression models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA) to forecast insect populations.
âœ… Developed classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict conditions affecting insect captures.
âœ… Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, accuracy, and F1-score.
âœ… Visualized insights through time-series plots, trend analysis, and feature importance charts.
